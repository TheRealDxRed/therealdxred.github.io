# Solutions

###**IF IT WASN'T ALREADY OBVIOUS, THIS WIKI CONTAINS SPOILERS FOR [MY WRITING BLOG](http://fiction.dxred.net/)!**
This is a list of solutions for all the puzzles associated with my writing. I strongly suggest trying out the puzzles before looking them up here. Some of them are actually way easier than you think. If you've already tried them and feel stumped, or if you just don't feel like bothering, this is the place for you. For those of you who don't want the story or puzzles spoiled for you, [here](non-spoilers.md) is a list of non-spoiler pages you can read.

###**[The Rules](rules.md)**
First things first: The Rules. When solving a puzzle, it's important to know its limits. Otherwise, you might just fall into a habit of over-complicating the puzzle. The Rules are a set of guidelines I follow when writing puzzles that make sure there is always a solution. If you're stumped on a puzzle, reading through The Rules, might eliminate any crazy ideas I wouldn't think of using.

###**My [Toolbox](toolbox.md)**
"What kind of tools did you use to make this and what should I use to solve it?"
My Toolbox is a list of all the software tools and concepts I use when designing puzzles but keep in mind, like any artist, I don't plan to stop finding and developing new tools to keep the game interesting.
