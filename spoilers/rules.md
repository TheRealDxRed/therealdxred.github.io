# The Rules

### Meta posts are allowed, but restricted
Any post I make to [the blog](http://fiction.dxred.net) with *CD* marked at the bottom is a meta post. Everything I write into a meta post is the truth, but none of it should be considered canon to the main story. This lets me talk about some ideas (any sometimes get feedback) anytime I need to without impacting my storyline.
Outside of that, this wiki can be considered one big meta post. I won't lie about solutions, but none of what I write here is "in character", so to speak.
### I can and **will** lie to you
Outside of meta posts, there's no telling whether anything I write is the truth. Obviously, the story itself might back-up or refute things, but you should never fully trust what I tell you at first glance.
### Never interfere with the writing
The actual story posts I make are meant to be read on their own. I will **never** hide puzzles in the text itself, but I will still use it as a solution-- or key-- from time to time.
### Your toolbox is never full
I spend a ridiculous amount of time reading about cryptology and cryptography, and every once in a while, I find a new tool to use for puzzles. My [Toolbox](toolbox.md) might get updated from time to time as I come across these new tools and use them in puzzles.
Now and again, I might also write a little program of my own, too. If these find themselves used in a puzzle, they'll end up in the Toolbox as well. (With their respective documentation, too)
### Sharing is caring
I don't have a problem with teamwork. In fact, I encourage it. An [ARG](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alternate_reality_game), which is the best way to describe my puzzles, is usually meant to be solved by a group, each giving their own unique perspectives on what the solution (or solutions) might be. But as long as you're sharing the answer, you're sharing the glory. There's no reward for solving these puzzles alone, so don't be a hog.
### Clues are okay, but they don't have to make sense
Feel free to ask for clues if you get stumped somewhere. I'll always give you an answer, but it won't always be straightforward. My clues will be vague enough that you'll still have to do some work, but they'll still have the answer in there somewhere.
